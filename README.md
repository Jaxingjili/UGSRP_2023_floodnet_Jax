# UGSRP_2023_floodnet_Jax
The Repository for Jax's code &amp; analysis for Floodnet project at NYU Tandon in summer 2023

## Check Individual Sensor Accuracy, folder name : date sensor number plots (example: 0606 sensor 2 plots)
For this analysis, we conducted simple experiment by moving the sensor with a track and check the sensor accuracy. 
The distance we are checking range from 1100mm to 3100mm with a 100mm offset, for each position we are taking the average of a hundred measurement.
The analysis shows the stats result and the distribution of the errors with visualization such as lineplots and heatmaps.
