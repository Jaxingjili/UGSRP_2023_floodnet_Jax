# UGSRP_2023_floodnet_Jax
The Repository for Jax's code &amp; analysis for Floodnet project at NYU Tandon in summer 2023


## Folders for Checking Sensor Accuracy
### Check Individual Sensor Accuracy, folder name : date sensor number plots (example: 0606 sensor 2 plots)
For this analysis, we conducted simple experiment by moving the sensor with a track and check the sensor accuracy. 
The distance we are checking range from 1100mm to 3100mm with a 100mm offset, for each position we are taking the average of a hundred measurement.
The analysis shows the stats result and the distribution of the errors with visualization such as lineplots and heatmaps.

### Check Sensors' stats, folder name: 0606 sensor stats
This notebook is used for checking the stats information cross different sensors

### Regressions for sensors, folder name: 0609_corss_sensors
### Combine sensor stats and regressions, folder name: 0626_reg_and_stats


## Checking critical angles, folder name: 0614 angle plot

## Analysing data from in field sensors
